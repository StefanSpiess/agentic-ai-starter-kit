# Guidelines Overview

This directory centralizes the repository's long-lived standards and decision records. Each subfolder focuses on a specific domain:

- `architecture`: Structural principles, patterns, and cross-cutting concerns.
- `product_vision`: Narrative, positioning, and experience guidelines.
- `security`: Policies, controls, and operational playbooks.

## How to Contribute
1. Choose the relevant domain folder and copy its template file.
2. Replace placeholders with concise, actionable guidance.
3. Reference related materials in `/guidelines` or `/agent-os-preview/standards` when helpful.
4. Update `AGENTS.md` if the guidance introduces notable decisions or obligations.

When adding a new domain, mirror this structure: include a short `README.md` and a template file outlining the expected sections for new guidance documents.
